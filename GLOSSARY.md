# Hypernode Technical Glossary

## Blockchain & Solana Terms

**SPL Token** - Solana Program Library token standard, equivalent to ERC-20 on Ethereum. HYPER is an SPL token with 9 decimals.

**PDA (Program Derived Address)** - Deterministic addresses derived from program IDs and seeds. Used for escrow accounts that don't have private keys.

**Lamports** - The smallest unit of SOL (1 SOL = 1,000,000,000 lamports). Similar to satoshis for Bitcoin or wei for Ethereum.

**Anchor** - Framework for building Solana programs in Rust. Provides IDL generation, type safety, and simplified account validation.

**Associated Token Account (ATA)** - Deterministic SPL token account address derived from a wallet address and token mint.

**CU (Compute Units)** - Measure of computational cost on Solana. Programs have CU budgets (default 200,000 CU per instruction).

## Hypernode System Components

**x402 Protocol** - Custom payment protocol for compute jobs. Implements lock → execute → verify → release flow with on-chain escrow.

**Facilitator** - Solana program that manages node registry, job assignments, and payment escrow. Acts as trustless coordinator.

**Oracle** - Off-chain service that verifies job execution and submits cryptographic proofs to blockchain for payment release.

**Node Client** - Software run by compute providers. Connects to facilitator, receives jobs via WebSocket, executes Docker containers.

**Backend API** - Express server managing WebSocket connections, job queue, database, and facilitator interaction.

## Technical Architecture

**WebSocket** - Bidirectional communication protocol. Used for real-time job streaming between backend and node clients.

**Docker Isolation** - Containerization technology ensuring secure, reproducible job execution. Each job runs in isolated environment.

**Escrow Pattern** - Payment held by smart contract until conditions met. In Hypernode: user → facilitator → node operator (after verification).

**Merkle Proof** - Cryptographic proof allowing efficient verification of job execution without revealing full data.

**Circuit Breaker** - Fail-safe mechanism that stops operations if error threshold exceeded. Prevents cascading failures.

## Compute & AI

**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** - Specialized hardware for parallel computations. Essential for AI training, inference, rendering.

**VRAM** - Video RAM on GPU. Determines how large AI models can fit in memory (e.g., 24GB VRAM can run 13B parameter models).

**CUDA** - NVIDIA's parallel computing platform. Required for GPU acceleration in most AI frameworks.

**Inference** - Running a trained AI model to generate predictions. Cheaper than training but still requires GPU for large models.

**LLM (Large Language Model)** - AI models with billions of parameters (e.g., Llama, Mistral). Require significant GPU resources.

**Model Quantization** - Reducing model precision (32-bit → 4-bit) to decrease memory usage and speed up inference.

## Economic & Token Terms

**HYPER Token** - Native SPL token of Hypernode. Used for:
- Paying for compute jobs
- Rewarding node operators
- Staking for facilitator operations

**Dynamic Pricing** - Compute costs determined by supply/demand. Idle capacity → lower prices, high demand → higher prices.

**Staking** - Locking HYPER tokens in facilitator to earn rewards and participate in oracle verification.

**Slashing** - Penalty mechanism where staked tokens are burned if node operators provide invalid results or facilitators act maliciously.

**Tokenomics** - Economic model governing token supply, distribution, rewards, and burning mechanisms.

## Security & Verification

**Zero-Trust Architecture** - System designed assuming all components could be compromised. Verification at every layer.

**Cryptographic Proof** - Mathematical proof that job was executed correctly. Verified on-chain before payment.

**Replay Attack Prevention** - Using nonces and timestamps to prevent reusing old proofs or transactions.

**Sandboxing** - Isolating job execution so malicious code cannot access host system or network.

**Multi-Signature (Multisig)** - Requiring multiple parties to approve transactions. Used for treasury and upgrade authority.

## Development & Operations

**IDL (Interface Definition Language)** - JSON schema generated by Anchor describing program structure and methods.

**PostgreSQL** - Relational database used by backend to store jobs, nodes, transactions, and analytics.

**TypeScript** - Typed superset of JavaScript. Used for frontend, backend, and Solana client code.

**Rust** - Systems programming language. Required for writing Solana programs. Memory-safe without garbage collection.

**Devnet** - Solana test network with free SOL. Used for testing before mainnet deployment.

**Mainnet** - Production Solana network with real economic value.

## Cross-Chain & Bridges

**Bridge** - Protocol enabling asset transfers between different blockchains (e.g., Solana ↔ Base).

**Wrapped Tokens** - Tokens representing assets from another chain. Base HYPER wraps Solana HYPER 1:1.

**Relayer** - Off-chain service that watches events on one chain and triggers transactions on another chain.

**Proof of Burn** - Locking tokens on source chain as proof for minting on destination chain.

## Acronyms

- **API** - Application Programming Interface
- **RPC** - Remote Procedure Call
- **JSON** - JavaScript Object Notation
- **UUID** - Universally Unique Identifier
- **JWT** - JSON Web Token
- **WebRTC** - Web Real-Time Communication
- **HTTP/WS** - HyperText Transfer Protocol / WebSocket
- **CRUD** - Create, Read, Update, Delete
